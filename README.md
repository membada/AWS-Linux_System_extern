The outline will be as follows -

You will need to create an (internet) externally facing Linux system (25%)
I will supply you with a public key 
You will create a user account for me so that I can securely sftp to the system using my private and public keypair - you will use the public key from step 2 (25%)
I should be able to download and upload files to this system (25%)
I should also be confined to the directory that I log into (25%)
